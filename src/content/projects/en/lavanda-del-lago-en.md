For this site, the goal was to create a fast, customizable, and functional storefront that met the client's expectations. We chose Next.js as the foundation of the application, integrating shadcn and Tailwind CSS to optimize the interface and user experience, and Sanity to provide a highly flexible and customizable CMS.

The main reason for not using WordPress and WooCommerce was performance. The client needed something fast and secure, as it was a brand solidifying itself as an authority in Spain. We chose pastel colors inspired by lavender to give it a personalized and elegant touch, and used Clerk for user authentication and management. We also added a local payment method, RedSys, to allow customers to make secure payments.
