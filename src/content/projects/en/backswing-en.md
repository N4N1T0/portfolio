For this site, the goal was to create a fast, customizable, and functional storefront that met the client's expectations. We chose Next.js as the application base, integrating shdcn and Tailwind CSS to optimize the interface and user experience.

We used WordPress and WooCommerce for the backend store due to their great capability to set up a virtual store and ease of learning. We added some plugins to improve this interaction, such as JWT for authorization and Headless so the client can use it exclusively.
