To completely overhaul an outdated WordPress website, I harnessed the power of **Next.js**, ideal for combining static and dynamic rendering. This approach efficiently handled static content, like institutional information, alongside a dynamic section featuring advanced product filters. Next.js ensures exceptional performance and a seamless user experience, crucial for driving conversions.

Additionally, I integrated technologies such as **Sanity** for agile content management, **Tailwind CSS** for a consistent and optimized design, and **Shadcn/ui** for customizable components. Security and efficiency were bolstered using **NextAuth.js** for authentication. The result: a modern, fast, and adaptable website that blends speed, design, and functionality to exceed the client’s expectations.
