To create dynamic static sites for small businesses, I choose Astro for its ultrafast performance, which allows for quick page loads and an exceptional user experience. Shadcn contributes to the visual appeal, providing a robust and efficient solution for shadow generation, enhancing the site's aesthetics without compromising speed.

Tailwind CSS streamlines the design process, offering a utility-based approach that speeds up development while maintaining a polished and responsive design. This trio of Astro, Shadcn, and Tailwind perfectly combines speed, visual appeal, and design efficiency, enabling small static sites to not only look impressive but also perform exceptionally online.
