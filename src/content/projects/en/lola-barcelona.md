For this project, the goal was to develop a customized Shopify store that was not only functional but also capable of enhancing the user experience and optimizing sales. We started with a base Shopify theme and then customized its design, adding new upselling and cross-selling components to increase sales.

We used Liquid to customize the store template, which allowed us to create advanced functionalities such as personalized recommendations and dynamic promotions. Additionally, we developed a custom Shopify app to integrate additional sales and product management features.

The approach was to ensure a smooth user experience, with fast loading times and intuitive navigation, making it easy for customers to make purchases while discovering related products that increased the average cart value.
