  "challenge": "The client needed a fast, secure, and lightweight website with high SEO performance, but also powerful enough to support advanced e-commerce logic. Their catalog included multiple products with interrelated variants and conditional attributes, requiring a flexible content structure and backend logic capable of supporting dynamic filtering, availability rules, and a seamless UX across devices.",
  "solution": "We chose Sanity as the CMS for its ability to model complex product schemas with custom relationships and structured data. Next.js served as the frontend framework, providing the power and flexibility needed to implement custom business logic and performance-optimized rendering. Resend and React Email were used to automate customer communications, such as order confirmations and newsletters, keeping the system cohesive and scalable."
