## Challenges in Digital Projects

The complexity of digital projects often presents challenges, especially with changing requirements and tight deadlines. Adopting agile principles like Scrum can be the key to addressing these challenges and enhancing team efficiency.

## Scrum in Action

With Scrum, the methodology breaks projects into short "sprints" of work, typically 2 to 4 weeks. At the start of each sprint, priorities are set in collaboration with clients, designers, developers, and marketing specialists, creating constant alignment.

## User Stories and Estimations

User stories become the heart of planning, defining tasks in a simple and value-focused manner. Story point estimation, rather than time, provides an assessment of complexity, allowing for more accurate planning.

## Key Roles

Appointing a product owner and a Scrum Master is essential. The former represents the client/business, articulating goals and priorities, while the latter guides the team with processes. Daily meetings keep everyone in sync.

## Benefits of Sprints

The sprint methodology enables rapid completion and testing in short iterations, gathering frequent feedback. This not only detects issues early but validates the product direction. Flexibility between sprints allows adjustments based on learnings.

## Fostering Collaboration

Scrum encourages self-organized teams where each member has a voice. Multifunctional teams maximize efficiency through collaboration, breaking down silo barriers and fostering creativity.

## Predictable Results

Scrum facilitates the delivery of digital and marketing projects in a more predictable manner, even with changing requirements. The process keeps stakeholders engaged and the work transparent, also allowing space for creativity and innovation along the way.
