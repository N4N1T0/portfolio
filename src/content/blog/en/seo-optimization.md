In website construction, the connection between SEO and design is crucial for user-friendly navigation and understanding by search engines. By incorporating SEO best practices from the design phase, you can create a structure and experience that optimizes both usability and visibility in search engines.

## User Experience and Information Architecture

Start by designing intuitive navigation with logically grouped pages. Use meaningful headers, subheader, and lists to break down content into scannable segments. This approach makes it easy for search engines to index the site effectively and enhances the user experience.

## Keyword Prioritization

Naturally incorporate keywords in page titles, headers, URLs, and alternative text for images. Ensure to avoid over-optimization, maintaining a smooth and understandable reading experience for users.

## Focus on Key Pages

Highlight crucial pages such as the homepage, category pages, and location pages through internal and external links. A clear internal linking structure helps search engines understand the site's architecture and the relative importance of pages.

## Quality Multimedia

Integrate high-quality images, videos, and multimedia content to enhance the user experience. Accompany this with detailed alternative text in images, providing context for both screen readers and search engines.

## Usability Testing

Conduct usability tests to ensure that information architecture, navigation, and calls to action are clear and intuitive. An exceptional user experience supports SEO by making it easy for users to quickly find what they need.
